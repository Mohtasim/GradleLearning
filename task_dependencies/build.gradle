/*
We'll discuss three ways to configure the relationships between tasks:
`dependsOn`, `finalizedBy`, and `mustRunAfter`.

Task A `dependsOn` task B if task A can't do its work without task B having
done its work. To take a familiar example, when you're getting up in the
morning, you can't put on your shoes without putting on your socks first.
Let's declare and configure some tasks to represent this process.
*/

task putOnSocks {
    doLast {
        println "Putting on Socks."
    }
}

task putOnShoes {
    dependsOn "putOnSocks"
    doLast {
        println "Putting on Shoes."
    }
}
